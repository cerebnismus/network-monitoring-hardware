> "Oh no, not again." - The Bowl of Petunias (Another Network Monitoring System)

## Project Overview
The Bowl of Petunias project aims to create a comprehensive network monitoring system capable of analyzing the intricate signals traversing the network cosmos. Our mission is to dive into the depths of network data and uncover insights that will leave you contemplating the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.

## Features
- **Universal Network Monitoring**: Monitor network devices across all layers, from the fundamental physical layer to the intricate application layer.
- **Traversal Network Discovery**: Discover network devices across all layers, from the fundamental physical layer to the intricate application layer.
- **Big Data Services**: Harness the power of big data to capture, store, and analyze network data, opening up possibilities for deep insights and intelligent decision-making.
- **Real-Time Packet Analysis**: Analyze ICMP and SNMP packets with precision, extracting valuable information and unraveling the mysteries of network behavior. Process network data in real-time, providing you with up-to-the-minute insights and the ability to act swiftly in this ever-expanding universe of interconnected devices.
- **Alerting and Notification**: Receive alerts and notifications when network anomalies are detected, allowing you to take action and prevent potential disasters. Mail, SMS, IVR, In-App notifications, and more are supported. No matter where you are in the universe.

## Getting Started
The Bowl of Petunias is comprised of highly customizable and extensible modules, each with their own unique capabilities. The following modules are currently available:

- [bop-gsm](bop-gsm/)   GSM/GPRS communication module powered by the arduino
- [bop-eth](bop-eth/)   ethernet communication library powered by the arduino
- [bop-icmp](bop-icmp/) implementation of ICMP monitoring and ICMP packet analysis

Follow these steps to embark on your journey to the network universe:
