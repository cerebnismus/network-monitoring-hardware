> Network Monitoring using Arduino, Ethernet Shield, GSM Shield and ofcourse Raspberry Pi.

## Overview
Project aims to create a network monitoring system, capable of analyzing the signals. Dive into depths of computer networks.

## Features
- **Monitoring**: Monitor network devices.
- **Discovery**: Discover network devices across all layers.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze network packets like ARP, ICMP and SNMP with precision, extracting valuable information and unraveling the network behavior.
- **Events**: Receive events from devices, using protocols like snmp-trap.

## Getting Started
The Bowl of Petunias is comprised of highly customizable and extensible modules, each with their own unique capabilities. The following modules are currently available:

- [bop-gsm](bop-gsm/)   GSM/GPRS communication module powered by the Arduino.
- [bop-eth](bop-eth/)   custom ethernet communication library for Arduino.
- [bop-icmp](bop-icmp/) implementation of multithreaded ICMP monitoring and ICMP packet analysis on Arduino.

Follow these steps to embark on your journey to the computer networks universe:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
- ```git clone https://github.com/cerebnismus/network-monitoring-hardware.git```
2. Customize and enhance the project to suit your monitoring needs.
